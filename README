//The program allow for the creation of a Shell.
//The user's input is broken into arguments that will be used to exicute commands.
//These arguments can include input and output redirects.
//The user may also input the command to run in the background or foreground.

//A fork of the parent prossess is created to run the command.
//The parent process will wait for the child process to finish if it is a foreground process.
//If the command is a background process, the parent will not wait for the child to finish.
//When the user inputs "exit", the shell will terminate.
//If there are any background processes running, 
//the shell will wait for them to finish before terminating to prevent zombie process.
